# About

This repository contains my DSTI Python Labs Project. The objective of the code deployed here is to provide an automation tool for training, validating and testing an ensemble of machine learning models predicting stroke in a set of patients.

# Prerequisites

The following components are recommended prerequisites:

- [Python 3.6.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) - once Python has been installed

# Installation

(1) Clone/download/unzip this repository in the working folder of your choice (you must have read, write and execute rights in it).

(2) Using the OS terminal, navigate to the working folder and type: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

(3) Using Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the working folder and open the `stroke_prediction.ipynb` notebook

(4) Edit the `path=r'C:\Users\slukyanc\Desktop\Machine Learning with Python Labs'` line by substituting the OS path to your working folder

# Running

(1) Edit the run parameter values in the `#Run by defining the parameter values:` section (scroll down or use Find to reach it)

(2) Use the `Run All` command in the `Cell` menu in Jupyter Notebook

(3) Review the outputs produced under the `#Run by defining the parameter values:` section (NB: the very last output - simulation of accuracy - may take 1-2 minutes to appear, the simulation progress is indicated by the `... out of 10 simulation runs completed.` messages displayed in the `#Simulate accuracy:` section)
